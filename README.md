🚗 RC WiFi Car with ESP8266 and Arduino
This project is a DIY RC (Remote-Controlled) WiFi Car built using an ESP8266 WiFi module and Arduino Uno, enabling wireless control through a smartphone or web browser. It combines IoT principles and embedded systems to create a fun and educational robotics project that’s perfect for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

🔧 Features
📶 WiFi-based remote control using ESP8266

📱 Smartphone-compatible interface (via web page)

🔋 Low power consumption and lightweight design

🧠 Controlled via a simple HTML/JavaScript-based web UI

🚦 Supports forward, reverse, left, right, and stop commands

🤖 Easily modifiable and expandable with sensors (ultrasonic, IR, etc.)

🧰 Hardware Used
ESP8266 (NodeMCU/ESP-01)

Arduino Uno (or Nano)

L298N Motor Driver Module

DC Motors with wheels

Power supply (Battery pack or USB)

Chassis for mounting

Jumper wires & Breadboard

📡 How It Works
The ESP8266 acts as a WiFi access point and web server, hosting a simple web page with control buttons. When you press a button (e.g., "Forward" or "Left") on your phone or PC, it sends an HTTP request to the ESP8266. The ESP then communicates with the Arduino via serial communication, and the Arduino controls the motors accordingly through the L298N driver.

💻 Software & Programming
Arduino IDE for uploading code to both ESP8266 and Arduino

HTML/JavaScript for the web interface

Serial communication for ESP8266 ↔ Arduino

Simple and modular code, easy to modify

🎯 Applications
Robotics and embedded systems learning

IoT and automation experiments

Prototyping smart car systems

Great for school/college projects

⚠️ Note: Ensure you have basic knowledge of Arduino programming, circuit building, and ESP8266 networking setup before starting.
